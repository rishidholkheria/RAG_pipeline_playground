# 🧪👾 RAG Pipeline Playground  

This repo is my **personal playground for learning Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.🧩

---

## 📚 What’s Inside (so far)  
Currently implemented:  
- 🤗 **HuggingFace models** for embeddings / LLMs  
- 🗂️ **PyPDFLoader** for document ingestion
- ⚡ **FAISS** as an alternative vector search backend  
- 🗄️ **ChromaDB** for vector storage & retrieval  


🎯I’ll be updating it as I explore new tools, techniques, and best practices. The goal is to experiment with different pipelines and keep improving my understanding of RAG step by step.
