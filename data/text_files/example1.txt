The LangChain framework consists of multiple open-source libraries. Read more in the Architecture page.

langchain-core: Base abstractions for chat models and other components.
Integration packages (e.g. langchain-openai, langchain-anthropic, etc.): Important integrations have been split into lightweight packages that are co-maintained by the LangChain team and the integration developers.
langchain: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.
langchain-community: Third-party integrations that are community maintained.
langgraph: Orchestration framework for combining LangChain components into production-ready applications with persistence, streaming, and other key features. See LangGraph documentation.
